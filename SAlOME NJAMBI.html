    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Salome Njambi, and I am an agricultural extension agent from Kenya. I am currently enrolled in the Power Learn program to gain software development skills that will help improve agriculture production in our country.</p>
</section>

<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about leveraging technology to enhance agricultural practices and improve the livelihoods of farmers. Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between traditional farming methods and modern innovations.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Market Linkage and Agri-commerce Platform</h3>
            <p>Develop an online marketplace where farmers can directly connect with buyers, such as supermarkets, restaurants, and wholesalers. The platform can also provide features like price forecasting, supply chain management, and logistics support to streamline the agricultural value chain, ensuring fair prices for farmers and improving market access.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Crop Disease Detection and Management System</h3>
            <p>Develop a mobile or web application that utilizes image recognition technology to identify crop diseases. Farmers can simply take a picture of the affected crop using their smartphones and the app will diagnose the disease and recommend suitable management practices. This can help farmers in timely intervention, reducing crop losses, and increasing yields.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Farm Management and Decision Support Tool</h3>
            <p>Create a comprehensive farm management software that enables farmers to plan, track, and analyze various aspects of their operations, including crop rotation, field mapping, labor management, and financial tracking. The tool can also provide decision support through predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, helping farmers make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and profitability.</p>
